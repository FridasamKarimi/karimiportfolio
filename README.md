## 📋 Our Approach
- **Layout Building:** We divided the sections: Navbar, Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact.
- **Styling:** Bootstrap’s grid system was heavily used for responsiveness, along with custom CSS to match the original style.
- **Assets:** Icons and fonts were matched closely using Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
- **Responsiveness:** We tested and adjusted the site for various screen sizes, ensuring mobile, tablet, and desktop compatibility.
- **Collaboration:** Work was coordinated via GitHub, ensuring every member peer-reviewed the sections.
